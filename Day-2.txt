🚀 Welcome to Day 2 of Data Science with Timmy! 🚀

Hello there, it's Day 2 already! It's impressive to see you back here again. Cheers to your commitment! 🎉

So, how did your research go? Oh, and I almost forgot, I hope you're having a fantastic day? Awesome! Now, let's dive into the important stuff: Were your findings motivating enough to keep you on this path? 💪

Alright, let's move forward.

Today's question is: How do you learn Data Science?

The answer lies in your programming skills. I'm sure your research yesterday touched upon Python or R programming. Here's a tip:

🐍 Python: A versatile language with numerous libraries applicable to almost any tech aspect. It's a powerhouse.
📊 R: A beautiful language primarily designed for analysis, with plenty of packages for creating stunning visualizations.
So, which one should you learn—Python or R?

My advice: Learn both, but start with Python. There's hardly any visualization task in R that can't be done in Python. Moreover, most popular data science libraries and frameworks are built with Python, so mastering Python opens doors to a plethora of opportunities. However, don't overlook R. You don't want to limit yourself to just one language. Say no to restrictions and limitations!

As for me, I know both Python and R. However, I work with Python every day, so my expertise in R isn't at the same level. Nonetheless, every win counts. If a project comes along requiring R, I'll tackle it excellently. Yes, I will. 💼

Now, what do you need to know about Python to get started?

Fundamentals: Focus on the basics. Build a solid foundation by understanding data classes (str, int, float), data structures (list, tuple, dictionary, set), creating functions, classes, and so on. Trust me, mastering these basics lays the groundwork for becoming an excellent data scientist.
Do you need to add more? No, that's enough information for today.

Here's your homework: Head over to YouTube and find tutorials that teach Python excellently. I won't recommend any specific ones, but if you need guidance, feel free to DM me.

I'm not a fan of 6-hour videos; an hour is sufficient. Watch a one-hour video multiple times until it sinks in properly. 📺

Thank you for joining us today. See you tomorrow as we start setting up!
